# linked-list-with-reverse

My solution for Chapter 9 Exercise 3 of “Introduction to Programming Using Java”.


Problem Description:
Suppose that linked lists of integers are made from objects belonging to the class
class ListNode {
int item; // An item in the list.
ListNode next; // Pointer to the next node in the list.
}
Write a subroutine that will make a copy of a list, with the order of the items of the list
reversed. The subroutine should have a parameter of type ListNode, and it should return
a value of type ListNode. The original list should not be modified.
You should also write a main() routine to test your subroutine.
